        <p>The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the
          providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients
          and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may be on the
          same device. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A
          client usually does not share its computing resources, but it requests content or service from a server and
          may share its own content as part of the request. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with
          servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are
          email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

      <h3 id="components">Components of Web Application</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A web application (or web app) is application software that is created with web technologies and runs via a
          web browser.[1][2] Web applications emerged during the late 1990s and allowed for the server to dynamically
          build a response to the request, in contrast to static web pages.[3]

          Web applications are commonly distributed via a web server. There are several different tier systems that web
          applications use to communicate between the web browsers, the client interface, and server data. Each system
          has its own uses as they function in different ways. However, there are many security risks that developers
          must be aware of during development; proper measures to protect user data are vital.

        <p>Web content is the text, visual or audio content that is made available online and user encountered as part
          of the online usage and experience on websites. It may include text, images, sounds and audio, online videos,
          among other items placed within web pages.

          In the book Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville wrote, "We
          define content broadly as 'the stuff in your website.' Web content may include webpage document pages,
          information, software data and applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages,
          archived e-mail messages stored on email servers, and more. And we include future web content as well as
          present web content roadmap."[1]: 219

      <h3 id="http-request">HTTP-HTTP Request</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server model. A web browser, for example, may be
          the client whereas a process, named web server, running on a computer hosting one or more websites may be the
          server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as
          HTML files and other content or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message
          to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain
          requested content in its message body.

          A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used
          by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that accesses, consumes,
          or displays web content.

          alt="" height="200px">
        <p>A dynamic web page is a web page constructed at runtime (during software execution), as opposed to a static
          web page, delivered as it is stored.

          A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server
          processing server-side scripts.[1] In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every
          new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client-side processing.

          A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads.
          JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model (DOM), to query page state and modify it. Even
          though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such
          as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there is not any server-side code included.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Application Server An application server is a server that hosts applications or software that delivers a
          business application through a communication protocol. For a typical web application, the application server
          sits behind the web servers. An application server framework is a service layer model. It includes software
          components available to a software developer through an application programming interface. An application
          server may have features such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing. The goal is for developers to
          focus on the business logic. Wikipedia

        <p>Web security encompasses a range of solutions and security policies that organizations rely on to protect
          their networks, users and assets from various security risks.

          For enterprises, web security is critical to preventing costly cyberattacks—such as malware, phishing,
          distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and more—that can disrupt core business practices and cause
          catastrophic reputational damage.

          The number of ways cybercriminals can gain unauthorized access to an organization’s data and
          resources—vulnerabilities known as ‘attack surfaces’—has increased exponentially. When applied effectively,
          web security safeguards the web applications businesses depend on from a wide range of malicious activities.
          These activities range from simple malware and phishing attempts that result in data theft to complex
          cyberattacks that target millions of users and can shut down business operations for days.
